## 🤝 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/screenappai/meeting-bot.git
   cd meeting-bot
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/meeting-bot.git
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local configuration
```

### 3. Start Development Server

**Option A: Local Development**
```bash
npm start
```

**Option B: Docker Development (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check if the server is running
curl http://localhost:4000/isbusy

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests (if available)
npm test
```

## 🔧 Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Test the API endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/google/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bearerToken":"test","url":"https://meet.google.com/test","name":"Test Bot","teamId":"test","timezone":"UTC","userId":"test"}'
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files next to the source files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from '@playwright/test';

describe('GoogleMeetBot', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  it('should join a Google Meet successfully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle invalid meeting URLs', async () => {
    // Test error handling
  });
});
```

## 📤 Submitting Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add support for new meeting platform"
```

### 2. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request

- **Type of Change**: Bug fix, feature, documentation, etc.
- **Testing**: How have you tested these changes?
- **Breaking Changes**: Does this introduce breaking changes?
- **Related Issues**: Link to any related issues

## 📝 Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await over Promises when possible

### File Organization

```
src/
├── app/           # Express routes and middleware
├── bots/          # Platform-specific bot implementations
├── lib/           # Core utilities and libraries
├── services/      # Business logic
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
└── util/          # Helper functions
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (`google-meet-bot.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`GoogleMeetBot`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (`joinMeeting`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RECORDING_DURATION`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with `I` prefix (`IMeetingConfig`)

### Code Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
npm run lint

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```
